				We are a group of people advocating for breakfast in bed.  Do we love breakfast?  Yes.  Do we love bed?  Yes!  Can we just do both at the same time?  Heck yeah!
			</p>

			<p>
				We are advocates for breakfast in bed because we like to sleep, and we like food.  Our passion in life is consolidating our interests into neat packages so we can reap as much goodness from the little things in life as possible.  
			</p>

			<p>
				As an organization we connect people with best practices in bed-breakfasting such as recipes, mattress and sheet recommendations, and how to nail that perfect breakfast-in-bed-selfie!

				We are a non-profit organization, operating as an educational resource.
